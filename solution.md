# Project Purple Cow

## Running the project

To run the project, run `yarn start`

## Future Updates

Updates that I would add in the future:

- More robust error handling.
- Add a loading state/animation for the count on initial page load and when calling the API after button click.
- Add a package to handle CSS preprocessing.
